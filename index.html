                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Ellman and I am from Columbus, OH. I attended the Rochester Institute of Technology and studied Web Development and Online Marketing. If you have any interest in my experience, <a target="blank" href="uploads/DanielEllmanResume.pdf"> take a look at my resume</a>.</p>

                <p>My focus is on Front End Development, which means I focus on what the user sees, and how they interact with the website. I know HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React. I have also made and published apps using React Native</p>

                <p>When I'm not playing with a new technology or working on a side project, you can find me hanging out with friends, playing games (board, tabletop, video, and card), listening to music, reading, or writing.</p>
